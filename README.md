# CO2 Neutral App's Server

## Description

The app focuses on carbon contribution of activities individually, hence the user know his/her costlier activities in terms of CO2 emissions. The app is divided mainly into 2 parts, auto calculator and manual calculator. The idea behind auto calculator is that, every SMS received by users gives lot of information about their day-to-day activities. For example, the ATM withdrawal, online transactions, product deliveries and cab rides, can known by reading SMS. Since these activities release carbon at low and high levels, for ATM/online transaction it may be low but for private cab rides it may be high. Hence the app analyses this data and produces general information chart which displays individual CO2 contributions of activities. Second part is manual calculation which allows users to manually calculate transport emission if it was not discovered from SMS. This allows to know the CO2 emissions of his travel in terms of Carbon Equivalent (CE).
